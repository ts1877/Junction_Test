## _The Peasant Dance_

Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c 1525-1569) was a painter active in Holland and Flanders. He spent a number of years studying in Italy and was instrumental in bringing the lessons of the Italian Renaissance to the Netherlands. He did not, however, directly imitate Italian art; his works follow in the Northern European tradition established by Jan Van Eyck and Robert Campin, which emphasized filling the picture with significant and accurately-rendered detail, while Italian painters concentrated more on the overall design of the piece. Bruegel is one of the first European painters to paint scenes from a distant perspective, such that the human world shrinks in comparison with the landscape around it, an innovation that eventually gave rise to landscape painting (though Bruegel himself was always at pains to include human activities within the context of his landscapes; in essence, his interest was the human world in its natural context, not nature per se). Here we see one example of Bruegel’s mastery of “genre painting” — the depiction of typical scenes of daily (often working class) life.[^1]
